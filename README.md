## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

   - My project makes a pixel art of a watermelon on a 16x16 grid and paints it on a light blue background. It kind of looks like the minecraft watermelon, but it is less detailed. 

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

   - I am proud of the final result of the project
   - I am proud I made methods that could shorten down the code and make the code more efficient.

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

   - I would definetly make my code even more efficient. I could have made more methods that could have shortened the code even more, which I will definetly try to do better next time.
